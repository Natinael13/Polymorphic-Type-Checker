# Polymorphic-Type-Checker



# What I Learned

* Experience the language designer’s side of monomorphic type systems: adding new types (lists) by designing new syntax and writing new typing rules.
* Experience the programmer’s side of polymorphic type systems: writing highly expressive but notationally burdensome code.
* Experience the language implementor’s side of monomorphic type systems: augmenting a monomorphic type checker to handle a new type (arrays).
* Experience the language implementor’s side of polymorphic type systems: implementing a polymorphic type checker from scratch.
