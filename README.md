# Polymorphic-Type-Checker

TuschemeChecker.sml - Created a type checker for Typed uScheme by implementing functions typdef (for type-checking definitions) and typeof (for type-checking expressions) in the provided ML file TuschemeChecker.sml

TimpcoreChecker.sml - Given an incomplete type-checker for Typed Impcore; I completed it so that it can handle arrays. My work was done through modifying the typeof function in the provided ML file TimpcoreChecker.sml

# What I Learned

* Experience the language designer’s side of monomorphic type systems: adding new types (lists) by designing new syntax and writing new typing rules.
* Experience the programmer’s side of polymorphic type systems: writing highly expressive but notationally burdensome code.
* Experience the language implementor’s side of monomorphic type systems: augmenting a monomorphic type checker to handle a new type (arrays).
* Experience the language implementor’s side of polymorphic type systems: implementing a polymorphic type checker from scratch.
